# Q3. In an exam, there were 20 multiple-choice questions. Each question had 44 possible options. A student knew the answer to 10 questions, but the other 10 questions were unknown to him, and he chose answers randomly. If the student X's score is equal to the total number of correct answers, then find out the PMF of X. What is P(X>15)?
